            <div>Athena employs a collaborative multi-agent system built using the AutoGen framework. These specialized AI agents work together:</div>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-4">
              <li>A <strong>Course Planner Agent</strong> 🗺️ designs a logical course structure (modules and lessons).</li>
              <li>A <strong>Module Research Agent</strong> 🔍 gathers relevant and up-to-date information for each section.</li>
              <li>A <strong>Lesson Writer Agent</strong> ✍️ synthesizes information into explanations, examples, and analogies tailored to your preferences.</li>
              <li>A <strong>Quiz Master Agent</strong> 📝 generates quizzes and other active learning activities to reinforce your understanding.</li>
              <li>A <strong>Course Assembler</strong> 🧩 checks content accuracy and assembles everything into a cohesive, structured course.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
